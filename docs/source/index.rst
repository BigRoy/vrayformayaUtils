V-ray for Maya Utils
============================================

The vrayForMayaUtils package is a framework/library that eases scripting for V-ray in Autodesk Maya.

It implements quick solutions that allow you to stay in control over your V-ray data in your scenes. If you often find
yourself adding or removing v-ray attributes, managing your render elements or working with objectProperties then the
``vrayForMayaUtils`` package can really keep you up to speed and helps optimizing your (scripted) workflow.

Basically it implements a lot of Chaosgroup's functionality in a clean and documented way. Besides just wrapping
functions that are already there it adds error checking, validating correct node types and other smart ways to actually
work with the data in your scene instead of searching through it most of the time.
