vrayformayaUtils
================

Framework that eases managing V-ray data/attributes in your Maya scenes.

The `vrayForMayaUtils` package contains functionality that allows TD's/Programmers to interact with V-ray in Maya in an
easier way.

A couple of focuses for vrayformayaUtils are:

- Autocomplete for functions

- Consistent framework

- Possibly object oriented where suitable

- Fast and easy to use

On the to-do list is adding a framework around objectProperties and then we should have covered the two
main areas (attributes and objectProperties) that benefit from automatisation.

There might be a focus in the future to do some (PySide?) GUI elements that aid in the v-ray for maya workflow.
