vrayformayaUtils
================

Framework that eases managing V-ray data/attributes in your Maya scenes.

The `vrayForMayaUtils` package contains functionality that allows TD's/Programmers to interact with V-ray in Maya in an
easier way.

A couple of focuses for vrayformayaUtils are:

- Autocomplete for functions

- Consistent framework

- Possibly object oriented where suitable

- Fast and easy to use

There might be a focus in the future to do some (PySide?) GUI elements that aid in the v-ray for maya workflow.


### Documentation

- Error-checking built-in.
- User-friendly.
- There's actually documentation for it. :)

###### Implementations

Currently implemented features are:

- V-ray Attributes
